- Changes -

* Made the start location dynamic so that a user could choose anywhere on the maze as their starting location.
* Added a "refresh" button for a new map.
* Changed the wall dimensions to accommodate for wall overlap. It may have been my display, but extended use on the same maze
  prior to the change caused portions of the maze's walls to disappear.
* Adjusted trail "timeout" for testing purposes.
* Variable speeds for trails

- My "to-do/wish I had time" list! -

^ PDF/email mazes
^ Spruce up the GUI
^ Option for pausing the trail
^ Option for removal of failed trails
^ looping feature (perhaps for self made screen savers)
^ adjustable maze sizes

- Thoughts -

> Crash course in DFS! At first, my initial thought would be to approach DFS from a matrix point of view, but I am not as versed in
  matrices as I would like. Looks like I know what I'll be jumping into soon!
> One feature I would pursue would be adding in a "shortest route" path. Several times the algorithm found a way to the end but missed
  a much shorter route. If I had the time, I would tinker with what paths the algorithm found and select the shortest. Maybe store each
  path in a variable then run the shortest. That would mean a lot more strain on the computer, but given the size of the maze, I don't
  think too much. If the mazes we much larger, I can imagine there might be an issue with recursiveness.
> Craftyjs does have a lot of interesting functionality and I think I might just play with it more!
